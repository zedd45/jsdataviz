## Chapter 4: Creating Specialized Graphs

The first three chapters looked at different ways to create many of the common types of charts with Javascript. We saw how to create static bar, line, and scatter plots, how to make them interactive, and how to incorporate them in a complete page. Sometimes, though, a common chart type isn’t the best way to visualize your data. If that data has unique properties, or if you want to show it in an unusual way, a more specialized chart might be the most appropriate format.

Fortunately, there are many Javascript techniques and plugins to expand our visualization vocabulary beyond the standard charts. In this chapter we’ll look at approaches for several specialized chart type, including

* How to combine hierarchy and dimension with tree maps
* How to highlight regions with heat maps
* How to track projects using Gantt charts
* How to show links between elements with network graphs
* How to reveal language patterns with word clouds
