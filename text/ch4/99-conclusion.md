### Summing Up

In this chapter weâ€™ve looked at several different special-purpose visualizations and some JavaScript libraries that can help us create them. Tree maps are handy for showing both hierarchy and dimension in a single visualization. Heat maps can highlight varying intensities throughout a region. Gantt charts show the relationships and dependencies between tasks in a project. Network graphs reveal the connections between objects. And word clouds show relative relationships between language properties in an attractive and concise visualization.
