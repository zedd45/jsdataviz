### Highlighting Regions with a Heat Map

If you work in the web industry, heat maps may already be a part of your job. Usability researchers often use heat maps to evaluate site designs, especially when they want to analyze which parts of a web page get the most attention from users. Heat maps work by overlaying values, represented as semi-transparent colors, over a two-dimensional area. As the example below shows, different colors represent different levels of attention. Users focus most on areas colored red, and the focus less on yellow, green, and blue areas.

For this example we’ll use a heat map to visualize an important aspect of a basketball game: from where on the court are the teams making most of their points. The software we’ll use the [heatmap.js](http://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/) library from Patrick Wied. If you need to create traditional web site heat maps, that library includes built-in support for capturing mouse movements and mouse clicks on a web page. Although we won’t use those features for our example, the general approach is much the same.

#### Step 1: Include the Required Javascript

For modern browsers, the heatmap.js library has no additional requirements. The library includes optional additions for real-time heat maps and for geographic integration, but we won't need these in our example. Older browsers (principally Internet Explorer version 8 and older) can use heatmap.js with the _explorer canvas_ library. Since we don't need to burden all users with this library, we'll conditional comments to include it only when it's needed. Following current best practices, we include all script files at the end of our `<body>`.

```language-markup
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!--[if lt IE 9]><script src="js/excanvas.min.js"></script><![endif]-->
    <script src="js/heatmap.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Step 2: Define the Visualization Data

For our example, we’ll visualize the NCAA Mens’ Basketball game on 13 February 2013 between Duke University and the University of North Carolina. Our [dataset](http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/gametracker/live/NCAAB_20130213_UNC@DUKE) contains details about every point scored in the game. To clean the data, we convert the time of each score to minutes from the game start, and we define the position of the scorer in x and y coordinates. We’ve defined these coordinates using several important conventions:

* We’ll show North Carolina’s points on the left side of the court and Duke’s points on the right side.
* The bottom left corner of the court corresponds to position (0,0), and the top right corner corresponds to (10,10).
* To avoid confusing free throws with field goals, we’ve given all free throws a position of (-1,-1).

Here’s the beginning of the data; the full data is available with the book’s [source code](https://github.com/sathomas/jsdataviz).

```language-javascript
var game = [
    { team: "UNC",  points: 2, time: 0.85, unc: 2, duke: 0, x: 0.506, y: 5.039 },
    { team: "UNC",  points: 3, time: 1.22, unc: 5, duke: 0, x: 1.377, y: 1.184 },
    { team: "DUKE", points: 2, time: 1.65  unc: 5, duke: 2, x: 8.804, y: 7.231 },
...
```

#### Step 3: Create the Background Image

A simple diagram of the basketball court works fine for our visualization. We can use each team’s color to highlight which side will show their points. The dimensions of our background image are 556 by 333 pixels.

![Diagram of Basketball Court](img/basketball.png)


#### Step 4: Set Aside an HTML Element to Contain the Visualization

In our web page, we need to define the element (generally a `<div>`) that will hold the heat map. For now, let’s keep it simple and use a single element. In later steps we’ll get fancy and add some additional markup. When we create the element, we specify its dimensions, and we define the background. The fragment below does both of those using inline styles to keep the example concise. You might want to use a CSS style sheet in an actual implementation

```language-markup
<div id='heatmap' style=“position:relative;width:556px;height:333px;background-image:url('img/basketball.png');"></div>
```

Notice that we’ve given the element a unique `id`. The heatmap.js library needs that `id` to place the map on the page. Most importantly, we also set the `position` property to `relative`. The heatmap.js library positions its graphics using absolute positioning, and we want to contain those graphics within the parent element.

##### Step 5: Format the Data

For our next step, we must convert the game data into the proper format for the library. The heatmap.js library expects individual data points to contain three properties:

1. the `x` coordinate, measured in pixels from the left of the containing element
2. the `y` coordinate, measured in pixels from the top of the containing element
3. the magnitude of the data point (specified by the `count` property)

The library also requires the maximum magnitude for the entire map, and here things get a little tricky. With standard heat maps, the magnitudes of all the data points for any particular position sum together. In our case that means that all the baskets scored from layups and slam dunks—which are effectively from the same position on the court—are added together by the heat map algorithm. That one position, right underneath the basket, dominates the rest of the court. To counteract that effect, we specify a maximum value far less than what the heat map would expect. In our case, we’ll set the maximum value at `3`, corresponding to a three-point basket. With that maximum the heat map algorithm will color any three-point shot red, and we’ll be able to easily see all the baskets.

We can use Javascript to transform the `game` array into the appropriate format. We start by fetching the height and width of the containing element. If those dimensions change, our code will still work fine. Then we initialize the `dataset` object with a `max` property and an empty `data` array. Finally, we iterate through the game data and add relevant data points to this array. Notice that we’re filtering out free throws.

```language-javascript
var height = document.getElementById("heatmap").clientHeight;
var width  = document.getElementById("heatmap").clientWidth;
var dataset = {};
dataset.max = 3;
dataset.data = [];
for (var i=0; i<game.length; i++) {
    if ((game[i].x !== -1) && (game[i].y !== -1)) {
        var x = Math.round(width  * game[i].x/10);
        var y = height - Math.round(height * game[i].y/10);
        dataset.data.push({"x": x, "y": y, "count": game[i].points});
    }
}
```

#### Step 6: Draw the Map

With a containing element and a formatted data set, it’s a simple matter to draw the heat map. We create the heat map object by specifying the containing element, a radius for each point, and an opacity. Then we add the data set to this object.

```language-javascript
var heatmap = h337.create({
    element: "heatmap",
    radius: 30,
    opacity: 50
});
heatmap.store.setDataSet(dataset);
```

The resulting visualization does a nice job of showing where each team scored its points.

<figure id='heatmap1' style="position:relative;width:556px;height:333px;background-image:url('img/basketball.png');"></figure>

#### Step 7: Bring the Visualization Alive

On the web we’re not limited to the constraints of a static medium, so let’s add some more interest to this visualization. We can turn it into a time lapse review of the entire game. We’ll start off with a blank court and add data points just as the teams scored in the actual game.

The heatmap.js library includes a function to incrementally add data points: `addDataPoint()`. Unfortunately, that function runs afoul of the trick we employed in step 3. It won’t let us keep the maximum value artificially low because it automatically recalculates that value with each addition. To circumvent the automatic calculation, we’ll have to modify the library’s source code. Thankfully the library is open source and the modification isn’t complicated. We simply copy the existing `addDataPoint` method to a new method and remove the code that recalculates the maximum value. We’ve called our new method `augmentDataPoint` in the code below.

```language-javascript
augmentDataPoint: function(x, y){
    if(x < 0 || y < 0)
        return;
        
    var me = this,
        heatmap = me.get("heatmap"),
        data = me.get("data");
        
    if(!data[x])
        data[x] = [];
        
    if(!data[x][y])
        data[x][y] = 0;
        
    // if count parameter is set increment by count otherwise by 1
    data[x][y]+=(arguments.length<3)?1:arguments[2];
            
    me.set("data", data);
//    // do we have a new maximum?
//    if(me.max < data[x][y]){
//        // max changed, we need to redraw all existing(lower) datapoints
//        heatmap.get("actx").clearRect(0,0,heatmap.get("width"),heatmap.get("height"));
//        me.setDataSet({ max: data[x][y], data: data }, true);
//        return;
//    }
    heatmap.drawAlpha(x, y, data[x][y], true);
},
```

The visualization setup is much the same. We create a heatmap object and an initial (empty) dataset. A simple Javascript timer is enough to activate and advance the replay. The `addPoint()` function adds data points to the heat map and reschedules itself repeatedly until all points are displayed.

```language-javascript
heatmap = h337.create({
    element: "heatmap",
    radius: 30,
    opacity: 50
});

dataset = {};
dataset.max = 3;
dataset.data = [];
heatmap.store.setDataSet(dataset);

var nextPoint = 0;
function addPoint() {
    var i = nextPoint++;
    if ((game[i].x !== -1) && (game[i].y !== -1)) {
        var x = Math.round(width  * game[i].x/10);
        var y = height - Math.round(height * game[i].y/10);
        heatmap.store.augmentDataPoint(x, y, game[i].points);
        $("#heatmap2 canvas").css("z-index", "1");
    }
    if (nextPoint < game.length) {
        setTimeout(addPoint, 500);
    }
};
```

You can adapt the styling to suit your own implementation, but as the example shows below, we can even include a scoreboard to keep track of the time and the score throughout the game replay.

<div style="width:636px; position:relative;top:20px">
<span style="float:left;padding-left:40px">North Carolina Tar Heels</span><span style="float:right;padding-right:40px">Duke Blue Devils</span>
</div>
<figure id='heatmap2' style="clear:both;float:left;position:relative;width:556px;height:333px;background-image:url('img/basketball.png');"></figure>
<div style="margin-top:16px;float:left;width:195px">
<div style="background-color:#666666;border-radius:6px;width:100%;padding:5px;">
  <div style="background-color:#222222;border:2px solid white;border-radius:4px;font-family:digital7;font-size:60px;color:white;display:table;margin:15px auto;line-height:60px;padding:4px 8px;">
  <span id="min">20</span>:<span id="sec">00</span>
  </div>
  <div style="display:table;margin:5px auto 15px auto">
    <div style="float:left;color:white;margin:0 15px;background-color:#222222;border:2px solid white;border-radius:4px;padding:0 5px;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNC<br/>
    <span style="font-family:digital7;font-size:50px;line-height:50px" id="unc">00</span>
    </div>
    <div style="float:left;color:white;margin:0 15px;background-color:#222222;border:2px solid white;border-radius:4px;padding:0 5px;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;DUKE<br/>
    <span style="font-family:digital7;font-size:50px;line-height:50px" id="duke">00</span>
    </div>
   </div>
</div>
<div style="padding-top:30px"><a class="btn" id="replay-game" href="#"><i class="icon-play-circle"></i> Replay Game</a></div>
</div>
<div style="clear:both">

#### Step 8: Adjust the Heat Map Z-Index

The heatmap.js library is especially aggressive in its manipulation of the `z-index` property. To ensure that the heat map appears above all other elements on the page, the library explicitly sets this property to a value of `10000000000`. If your web page has elements that you don’t want the heat map to obscure (such as fixed position navigation menus), that value is probably too aggressive. You can fix it by modifying the source code directly. Or, as an alternative, you can simply reset the value after the library finishes drawing the map.

If you’re using jQuery, the following code will reduce the z-index to a more reasonable value.

```language-javascript
$("#heatmap canvas").css("z-index", "1");
```
