### Building Time Lines with JavaScript

If you followed the example in the previous section, you might not be completely satisfied with the results. We did end up with an accurate time line of Shakespeare’s plays, but the resulting visualization may not be communicating what we want. For example, the time line doesn’t show the names of the plays unless the user hovers a mouse over that section of the graph. Perhaps we’d rather have the plays’ titles always visible. That kind of problem is a limitation of third-party libraries. The author of Chronoline.js didn’t see the need for displaying titles, so he didn’t offer the option. And unless we’re willing to take on the potentially daunting task of modifying the library’s source code, we can’t make the library do exactly what we want.

Fortunately, particularly in the case of time lines, a completely different approach is possible. We can create visualizations without using any third party library at all. With this approach we’ll have total control over the result. Time lines are especially amenable to this approach because they can be created with nothing more than text and styling. All it takes is a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, plus enough JavaScript to set things up and perhaps provide simple interactions.

That’s exactly what we’ll do in this example. We’ll start with the same data set as before. Instead of feeding that data into a third-party library, however, we’ll use plain old JavaScript (with an optional dose of jQuery) to construct a pure HTML representation of the data. Then we’ll use CSS to set the appearance of the time line.

#### Step 1: Prepare the HTML Skeleton

Without any required libraries, the HTML page for our timeline is pretty simple. All we need is a containing `<div>` with a unique `id` attribute.

```language-markup
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="timeline"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Step 2: Start JavaScript Execution

As soon as the browser has finished loading our page, we can start processing the data. As before, we’ll start with our data formatted as a JavaScript array. You can see the complete data set in the book’s [source code](https://github.com/sathomas/jsdataviz).

```language-javascript
window.onload = function () {
  var plays = [
    {
      "play": "The Two Gentlemen of Verona", 
      "date": "1589-1591",
      "record": "Francis Meres'…",
      "published": "First Folio (1623)",   
      "performance": "adaptation by Benjamin Victor…",
      "evidence": "The play contains…" 
    }, { 
      "play": "The Taming of the Shrew",     
      "date": "1590-1594", 
      "record": "possible version…", 
      "published": "possible version…", 
      "performance": "According to Philip Henslowe…",  
      "evidence": "Kier Elam posits…"
    }, { 
      "play": "Henry VI, Part 2",
      "date": "1590-1591", 
      "record": "version of the…",   
      "published": "version of the…",   
      "performance": "although it is known…",         
      "evidence": "It is known…" 
    },
    //…
}
```

#### Step 3: Create the Time Line in Semantic HTML

To create the timeline in HTML, we first need to decide how to represent it. If you’re used to working with arbitrary `<div>` and `<span>` elements, you might think that’s the best approach here as well. Instead of jumping right to these generic elements, however, it’s worth considering if there might be an HTML structure that more accurately conveys the content. HTML that more closely reflects the meaning of the underlying content is known as _semantic markup_, and it’s usually preferred over generic `<div>` and `<span>` tags. Semantic markup exposes the meaning of your content to computers such as search engines and screen readers for users with visual impairments, and it can improve your site’s search rank and its accessibility. If we think about a time line in the context of semantic markup, it’s easy to see that the time line is really just a list. In fact, it’s a list with a specific order. We should build our HTML time line, therefore, as an `<ol>` element. While we’re creating the `<ol>` we can also give it a class name for CSS style rules we’ll be adding later.

```language-javascript
var container = document.getElementById("timeline");
var list = document.createElement("ol");
list.className="timeline";
container.appendChild(list);
```

Next we can iterate through the plays, creating an individual list item `<li>` for each one. For now, we’ll just insert the date and title as text.

```language-javascript
plays.forEach(function(play) {
    var listItem = document.createElement("li");
    listItem.textContent = play.date + ": " + play.play;
    list.appendChild(listItem);
})
```

Here’s a truncated version of the resulting list. It may not look like much (yet), but it has the essential data and structure.

<div id="javascript-1"></div>

If you look at the resulting HTML that underlies that list, it’s pretty simple:

```language-markup
<ol class="timeline">
    <li>1589-1591: The Two Gentlemen of Verona</li>
    <li>1590-1594: The Taming of the Shrew</li>
    <li>1590-1591: Henry VI, Part 2</li>
    <li>1591: Henry VI, Part 3</li>
    <li>1591: Henry VI, Part 1</li>
</ol>
```

In the spirit of semantic HTML, we should stop and consider if that markup can be improved. Since it appears first in our list items, let’s consider the date or date range for a play. Although it hasn’t been without controversy, HTML5 has defined support for a `<time>` element to contain dates and times. Using that element as a wrapper will make our dates more semantic. The second part of each list item is the title of the play. As it happens, HTML5’s `<cite>` element is perfect for that content. To quote the [current standard](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-cite-element):

> The cite element represents the title of a work (e.g. a book, […] **a play,** […] etc). This can be a work that is being quoted or referenced in detail (i.e. a citation), or it can just be a work that is mentioned in passing. [Emphasis added.]

To add those elements to our code, we’ll have to distinguish between dates that are single years and those that are ranges. Looking for a dash `-` in the data will tell us which we have.

```language-javascript
plays.forEach(function(play) {
    var listItem = document.createElement("li");
    if (play.date.indexOf("-") !== -1) {
        var dates = play.date.split("-");
        var time = document.createElement("time");
        time.textContent = dates[0];
        listItem.appendChild(time);
        time = document.createElement("time");
        time.textContent = dates[1];
        listItem.appendChild(time);
    } else {
        var time = document.createElement("time");
        time.textContent = play.date;
        listItem.appendChild(time);
    }
    var cite = document.createElement("cite");
    cite.textContent = play.play;
    listItem.appendChild(cite);
    list.appendChild(listItem);
})
```

Because we’re no longer including the punctuation, the resulting output might look a little worse than before. Don’t worry, though, we’ll fix it soon.

<div id="javascript-2"></div>

What is much improved is the underlying HTML. The markup clearly identifies the type of content it contains, an ordered list of dates and citations.

```language-markup
<ol class="timeline">
    <li><time>1589</time><time>1591</time><cite>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</cite></li>
    <li><time>1590</time><time>1594</time><cite>The Taming of the Shrew</cite></li>
    <li><time>1590</time><time>1591</time><cite>Henry VI, Part 2</cite></li>
    <li><time>1591</time><cite>Henry VI, Part 3</cite></li>
    <li><time>1591</time><cite>Henry VI, Part 1</cite></li>
</ol>
```

#### Step 4: Include the Supporting Content

When we created a time line using the Chronoline.js library, we weren’t able to include the supporting content from Wikipedia because the library did not offer that option. In this example, though, we have complete control over the content, so let’s include that information in our time line. For most plays our data includes its first official record, its first publication, its first performance, and a discussion of the evidence. This type of content is perfectly matched to the HTML _description list_ `<dl>` so that’s how we’ll add it to our page. It can follow the `<cite>` of the play’s title.

```language-javascript
plays.forEach(function(play) {
    //…
    listItem.appendChild(cite);
    var descList = document.createElement("dl");
    // Add terms to the list here
    listItem.appendChild(descList);
    list.appendChild(listItem);
})
```

We can define a mapping array to help in adding the individual terms to each play. That array maps the property name in our data set to the label we want to use in the content.

```language-javascript
var descTerms = [
    { key: "record",      label: "First official record"},
    { key: "published",   label: "First published"},
    { key: "performance", label: "First recorded performance"},
    { key: "evidence",    label: "Evidence"},
];
```

With that array we can quickly add the descriptions to our content. We iterate over the array using `.forEach()`. At each iteration we make sure that the data has content (`play[term.key]` is not empty) before creating the description item. A description item contains the term(s) being described in one `<dt>` tag and the description itself in a `<dd>` tag.

```language-javascript
plays.forEach(function(play) {
    //…
    listItem.appendChild(cite);
    var descList = document.createElement("dl");
    descTerms.forEach(function(term) {
        if (play[term.key]) {
            var descTerm = document.createElement("dt");
            descTerm.textContent = term.label;
            descList.appendChild(descTerm);
            var descElem = document.createElement("dd");
            descElem.textContent = play[term.key];
            descList.appendChild(descElem);
        }
    });
    listItem.appendChild(descList);
    list.appendChild(listItem);
})
```

Our timeline is still lacking a bit of visual appeal, but it has a much richer set of content. In fact, even without any styling at all, it still communicates the essential data quite well.

<div id="javascript-3"></div>

Here’s the resulting markup (truncated for brevity):

```language-markup
<ol class="timeline">
    <li>
        <time>1589</time><time>1591</time><cite>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</cite>
        <dl>
            <dt>First official record</dt><dd>Francis Meres'…</dd>
            <dt>First published</dt><dd>First Folio (1623)</dd>
            <dt>First recorded performance</dt><dd>adaptation by…</dd>
            <dt>Evidence</dt><dd>The play contains…</dd>
        </dl>
    </li>
    <li>
        <time>1590</time><time>1594</time><cite>The Taming of the Shrew</cite>
        <dl>
            <dt>First official record</dt><dd>possible version…</dd>
            <dt>First published</dt><dd>possible version…</dd>
            <dt>First recorded performance</dt><dd>According to Philip…</dd>
            <dt>Evidence</dt><dd>Kier Elam posits…</dd>
        </dl>
    </li>
</ol>
```

#### Step 5: Optionally Take Advantage of jQuery

Our code so far has used nothing but plain JavaScript. If you’re using jQuery on your web pages, you can shorten the code a bit by taking advantage of some jQuery features. If your web pages aren’t using jQuery already, the minor enhancements in this step don’t justify adding it, so you can skip ahead to the next step.

Here’s the complete code so far with standard JavaScript:

```language-javascript
var descTerms = [
    { key: "record",      label: "First official record"},
    { key: "published",   label: "First published"},
    { key: "performance", label: "First recorded performance"},
    { key: "evidence",    label: "Evidence"},
];
container = document.getElementById("javascript-3");
list = document.createElement("ol");
list.className = "timeline";
container.appendChild(list);
plays.forEach(function(play) {
    var listItem = document.createElement("li");
    if (play.date.indexOf("-") !== -1) {
        var dates = play.date.split("-");
        var time = document.createElement("time");
        time.textContent = dates[0];
        listItem.appendChild(time);
        time = document.createElement("time");
        time.textContent = dates[1];
        listItem.appendChild(time);
    } else {
        var time = document.createElement("time");
        time.textContent = play.date;
        listItem.appendChild(time);
    }
    var cite = document.createElement("cite");
    cite.textContent = play.play;
    listItem.appendChild(cite);
    var descList = document.createElement("dl");
    descTerms.forEach(function(term)  {
        if (play[term.key]) {
            var descTerm = document.createElement("dt");
            descTerm.textContent = term.label;
            descList.appendChild(descTerm);
            var descElem = document.createElement("dd");
            descElem.textContent = play[term.key];
            descList.appendChild(descElem);
        }
    });
    listItem.appendChild(descList);
    list.appendChild(listItem);
})
```

Here, for comparison, is a jQuery version:

```language-javascript
var descTerms = [
    { key: "record",      label: "First official record"},
    { key: "published",   label: "First published"},
    { key: "performance", label: "First recorded performance"},
    { key: "evidence",    label: "Evidence"},
];
$list = $("ol").addClass("timeline");
$.each(plays, function(idx, play) {
    var $listItem = $("li");
    if (play.date.indexOf("-") !== -1) {
        var dates = play.date.split("-");
        $listItem.append($("time").text(dates[0]))
                 .append($("time").text(dates[1]));
    } else {
        $listItem.append($("time").text(play.date));
   }
    $listItem.append($("cite").text(play.play));
    var $descList = $("dl");
    $.each(descTerms, function(idx, term)  {
        if (play[term.key]) {
            $descList.append($("dt").text(term.label))
                     .append($("dd").text(play[term.key]));
        }
    });
    $listItem.append($descList);
    $list.append($listItem);
})
$("#timeline").append($list);
```

#### Step 6: Fix Time Line Problems with CSS

Now that we’ve built our time line’s content in HTML, it’s time to define the styles that determine its appearance. Throughout this example we’ll focus on the functional aspects of styling rather than pure visual elements such as fonts and colors. Those are styles that are undoubtedly specific to your own web site.

The first step is a simple one. We want to get rid of the numbering (1, 2, 3, ...) that browsers normally add to ordered list items. A single rule banishes them from our time line. By setting the `list-style-type` to `none` we tell the browser not to add any special characters to our list items.

```language-css
.timeline li {
    list-style-type: none;
}
```

We can also use CSS rules to add some punctuation to our semantic HTML. First we look for places where two `<time>` elements appear right after each other while skipping isolated `<time>` tags. The trick to finding `<time>` pairs is the CSS adjacent selector `+`. A rule with `time + time` specifies a `<time>` element that immediately follows a `<time>` element. To add the punctuation, we use the `:before` pseudo-selector to specify what we want to happen _before_ this second `<time>` tag, and we set the `content` property to indicate the content we want inserted.

```language-css
.timeline li > time + time:before {
    content: "-";
}
```

If you haven’t seen the `>` before in a CSS rule, it’s the direct descendent selector. In this example, it means that the `<time>` element must be an immediate child of the `<li>` element. We’re using this selector so our rules won’t inadvertently apply to other `<time>` elements that may be nested deeper within the list item’s content.

To finish up the punctuation, let’s add a colon and space after the last of the `<time>` elements in a list item. We have to use two pseudo-selectors for this rule. The `:last-of-type` selector will target the last `<time>` element in the list item. That’s the first `<time>` if there’s only one and the second `<time>` if both are present. Then we add the `:after` pseudo-selector to insert content after that `<time>` element.

```language-css
.timeline li > time:last-of-type:after {
    content: ": ";
}
```

With these changes we’ve cleaned up all of the obvious problems with our time line.

<style>
.timeline1 {
    padding-top: 1em;
}
.timeline1 li {
    list-style-type: none;
}
.timeline1 li > time + time:before {
    content: "-";
}
.timeline1 li > time:last-of-type:after {
    content: ": ";
}
</style>

<ol class="timeline1">
    <li>
        <time>1589</time><time>1591</time><cite>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</cite>
        <dl>
            <dt>First official record</dt><dd>Francis Meres'…</dd>
            <dt>First published</dt><dd>First Folio (1623)</dd>
            <dt>First recorded performance</dt><dd>adaptation by…</dd>
            <dt>Evidence</dt><dd>The play contains…</dd>
        </dl>
    </li>
    <li>
        <time>1590</time><time>1594</time><cite>The Taming of the Shrew</cite>
        <dl>
            <dt>First official record</dt><dd>possible version…</dd>
            <dt>First published</dt><dd>possible version…</dd>
            <dt>First recorded performance</dt><dd>According to Philip…</dd>
            <dt>Evidence</dt><dd>Kier Elam posits…</dd>
        </dl>
    </li>
</ol>

Now we can add a little flair to the visualization.

#### Step 7: Add Styles to Visually Structure the Time Line

The next set of CSS styles will improve the visual structure of the time line. First among those improvements will be making the time line look more like, well, a _line._ To do that we can add a border to the left side of the `<li>` elements. When we do that, we’ll also want to make sure that those `<li>` elements don’t have any margins, as margins would introduce gaps in the border and break the continuity of the line.

```language-css
.timeline li {
    border-left: 2px solid black;
}
.timeline dl,
.timeline li {
    margin: 0;
}
```

These styles add a nice vertical line on the left side of our entire time line. Now that we have that line, we can shift the dates over to the left side of it. The shift requires rules for the parent `<li>` as well as the `<time>` elements. For the parent `<li>` elements we want their `position` specified as `relative`.

```language-css
.timeline li {
    position: relative;
}
```

By itself, this rule doesn’t actually change our time line. It does, however, establish a _positioning context_ for any elements that are children of the `<li>`. Those children include the `<time>` elements that we want to move. With the `<li>` set to `position: relative` we can now set the `<time>` children to `position: absolute`. This rule lets us specify exactly where the browser should place the time elements, _relative_ to the parent `<li>`. We want to move all `<time>` elements to the left, and we want to move the second `<time>` element down. The first selector below will target both of our `<time>` tags while the second selector, using the same `time + time` trick described above, targets only the second of two `<time>` tags.

```language-css
.timeline li > time {
    position: absolute;
    left: -3.5em;
}
.timeline li > time + time {
    top: 1em;
    left: -3.85em;
}
```

Notice that we’re using `em` units rather than pixel `px` units for this shift. By using `em` units we define our shift to be relative to the current font size, regardless of what it is. That gives us the freedom to change the font size without having to go back and tweak any pixel positioning.

The specific values for the position shift may need adjustment depending on the specific font face, but, in general, we use a negative `left` position to shift content further to the left than it would normal appear, and a positive `top` position to move the content down the page.

After moving the dates to the left of the vertical line, we’ll also want to shift the main content a bit to the right so it doesn’t crowd up against the line. The `padding-left` property takes care of that. And while we’re adjusting the left padding we can also add a bit of padding on the bottom to separate each play from the other.

```language-css
.timeline li {
    padding-left: 1em;
    padding-bottom: 1em;
}
```

With the dates and the main content on opposite sides of our vertical line, there’s no longer any need for any punctuation after the date. We can, therefore, remove the style that adds a colon after the last `<time>` element.

<pre class="language-css" style="text-decoration:line-through"><code class="  language-css">.timeline li &gt; time:last-of-type:after {
    content: ": ";
}
</code></pre>

The fact that we’re able to make this change highlights one of the reasons for using CSS to add the colon in the first place. If we had included the punctuation explicitly in the markup (by, for example, generating it in the JavaScript code), then our markup would be more tightly coupled to our styles. If a style modification changed whether or not the colon was appropriate, we would have to go back and change the JavaScript as well. With the approach that we’re using here, however, styles and markup are much more independent. Any style changes are isolated to our CSS rules; no modifications to the JavaScript are required.

As part of the improved visual styling we can make a few other changes to our time line. We can increase the font size for each play’s title to make that information more prominent. At the same time we can add some extra spacing below the title, and we can indent the description list a bit.

```language-css
.timeline li > cite {
    font-size: 1.5em;
    line-height: 1em;
    padding-bottom: 0.5em;
}
.timeline dl {
    padding-left: 1.5em;
}
```

For a last bit of polish let’s add a bullet right on the vertical line to mark each plan and tie the title more closely to the dates. We use a large bullet (roughly 5 times the normal size) and position it right over the line. As you can see from the rules below, the unicode character for a bullet can be represented as `"\00B7"`.

```language-css
.timeline li > time:first-of-type:after {
	content: "\00B7";
	font-size: 5.2em;
	position: absolute;
	right: -0.35em;
	top: -0.05em;
}
```

Now our time line is starting to look like an actual time _line._ In your own pages you could include additional styles to define fonts, colors, and so on, but even without those decorations the visualization is effective.

<style>
.timeline2 li {
    list-style-type: none;
}
.timeline2 li > time + time:before {
    content: "-";
}
.timeline2 li {
    border-left: 2px solid #444444;
}
.timeline2 dl,
.timeline2 li {
    margin: 0;
}
.timeline2 li {
    position: relative;
    padding-left: 1em;
    padding-bottom: 1em;
}
.timeline2 li > time {
    position: absolute;
    left: -3.5em;
}
.timeline2 li > time + time {
    top: 1em;
    left: -3.85em;
}
.timeline2 {
    padding-left: 5em;
    padding-top: 1.5em;
}
.timeline2 li > cite {
    display: block;
    font-size: 1.5em;
    line-height: 1em;
    padding-bottom: 0.5em;
}
.timeline2 li > time:first-of-type:after {
	content: "\00B7";
	position: absolute;
	right: -0.35em;
	top: -0.05em;
	font-size: 5.2em;
}
.timeline2 dl {
    padding-left: 1.5em;
}
</style>

<ol class="timeline2">

Additionally, Stanley Wells argues that the scenes involving more than four characters, \"betray an uncertainty of technique suggestive of inexperience.\" As such, the play is considered to be one of the first Shakespeare composed upon arriving in London (Roger Warren, following E.A.J. Honigmann, suggests he may have written it prior to his arrival) and, as such, he lacked theatrical experience. This places the date of composition as most likely somewhere between 1589 and 1591, by which time it is known he was working on the Henry VI plays" },

This could have been either the 1594 A Shrew or the Shakespearean The Shrew, but as the Admiral's Men and the Lord Chamberlain's Men were sharing the theatre at the time, and as such Shakespeare himself would have been there, scholars tend to assume that it was The Shrew. The Shakespearean version was definitely performed at court before King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria on 26 November 1633, where it was described as being \"liked'.", "evidence": "Kier Elam posits a date of 1591 as a terminus post quem for the composition of The Shrew, based on Shakespeare's probable use of two sources published that year; Abraham Ortelius's map of Italy in the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (4th ed.) and John Florio's Second Fruits. However, scholars continue to debate the relationship between the 1594 A Shrew and the 1623 The Shrew. Some theorise that A Shrew is a reported text, meaning The Shrew must have been written prior to 2 May 1594; others, that A Shrew is an early draft, meaning The Shrew must have been completed sometime after 2 May 1594. There are also arguments that A Shrew may have been a source for The Shrew, that they could be two completely unrelated plays based on the same (now lost) source (the \"Ur-Shrew\" theory), or A Shrew could be an adaptation of The Shrew. Critics remain divided on this issue, and as such, dating the play is extremely difficult." },

Benson directed a production at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre.", "evidence": "It is known that the play was definitely on stage by early 1592 as in A Groatsworth of Wit, Bought with a Million of Repentance, Robert Greene mocked Shakespeare by parodying a line from 3 Henry VI. Groatsworth was registered in the Stationers' Register in September 1592, meaning True Tragedy/3 Henry VI must have been on stage prior to 23 June 1592 as that was when the government shut the London theatres due to an outbreak of plague. To have been on stage by June 1592, the play was most likely written some time in 1591." },

In August, Thomas Nashe published Piers Penniless his Supplication to the Devil, in which he refers to a play he had recently seen featuring a rousing depiction of Lord Talbot, a major character in 1 Henry VI. Most critics take Nashe's reference to Talbot as proof that the play Henslowe saw was 1 Henry VI. As such, to have been a new play in March 1592, it was most likely written some time in 1591. Furthermore, many critics consider 1 Henry VI to have been written as a prequel to the successful two-part play, The Contention and True Tragedy. Possibly co-written with Thomas Nashe and/or other unidentified dramatists." },

As such, the play must have been composed some time prior to September. Additionally, it is unlikely to have been written later than June 1592, as that was when the London theatres were closed due to an outbreak of plague. The theatres would remain shut for the better part of two years, not fully reopening until March 1594 and Shakespeare concentrated most of his energies during this period on poetry. As such, the play was most likely composed sometime between late-1591 and early 1592. Possibly co-written with George Peele" },

The Folio text appears under the title The Tragedy of Richard the Third, with the Landing of Earle Richmond, and the Battell at Bosworth Field.", "performance": "The play was performed extensively in Shakespeare's lifetime; it is mentioned in Palladis Tamia in 1598 (as \"Richard the 3.'), and by the time of the First Folio in 1623, had been published in quarto six times (1597, 1598, 1603, 1605, 1612 and 1622), and referenced by multiple writers of the day. Regarding specific performances however, there is little solid evidence. In 1602, John Manningham mentions seeing Richard Burbage playing the role of Richard III, but he offers no further information. The earliest definite performance was at St James's Palace on 16 or 17 November 1633 by the King's Men.", "evidence": "It is known that Richard III was definitely a sequel to 3 Henry VI, which was on-stage by 23 June 1592, hence Richard III must have been written later than early 1592. Additionally, it has been argued that the play contains evidence suggesting it was originally written for Strange's Men, but then rewritten for Pembroke's Men, a company which formed in mid-1592. Also, with the closure of the theatres due to an outbreak of plague in June 1592, the play was unlikely to have been written any later than that, all of which suggests a date of composition as sometime in early-1592." },

However, this production presented only the first half of the play (dealing with the King's infatuation with the Countess of Salisbury). Performed under the title, The King and the Countess, it was presented in a single matinée performance with the anonymous sixteenth century liturgical drama, Jacob and Esau. The first known performance of the complete text took place in June 1987, at the Theatr Clwyd, directed by Toby Robertson.", "evidence": "Obviously, the play was written by December 1595. According to the title page of the quarto, it had been performed recently in London, but no company information is provided. This could mean that the company that performed the play had disbanded during the closure of the theatres from June 1592 to March 1594. Furthermore, internal evidence suggests that the play may have been specifically written for Pembroke's Men, who ceased performing in September 1593. This places the date of composition as most likely somewhere between early 1592 and September 1593." },
  { "play": "The Comedy of Errors",            "date": "1594",      "record": "Francis Meres' Palladis Tamia (1598); referred to as \"Errors\"", "published": "First Folio (1623)", "performance": "probably on Innocents Day, 28 December 1594 at Gray's Inn (one of the four London Inns of Court). The only known evidence for this performance is the Gesta Grayorum, a 1688 text printed for William Canning based on a manuscript apparently handed down from the 1590s, detailing the \"Prince of Purpoole\" festival from December 1594 to February 1595.[c] According to the text, after a disastrous attempt to stage \"some notable performance […] it was thought good not to offer any thing of Account, saving Dancing and Revelling with Gentlewomen; and after such Sports, a Comedy of Errors (like to Plautus his Menaechmus) was played by the Players. So that Night was begun, and continued to the end, in nothing but Confusion and Errors; whereupon, it was ever afterwards called, The Night of Errors.\" As Comedy of Errors is indeed based on Menaechmus, this is almost universally accepted as a reference to an otherwise unrecorded performance of the play, probably by Shakespeare's own company, the newly formed Lord Chamberlain's Men.", "evidence": "traditionally, the play has been dated quite early (Ros King, for example, dates it 1586-1589), and has often been seen as Shakespeare's first comedy, perhaps his first play. However, stylistic and linguistic analysis (proportion of verse to prose, amount of rhyme, use of colloquialism in verse, and a rare word test) has placed it closer to the composition of Richard II and Romeo and Juliet, both of which were written in 1594 or 1595. More specifically, the limited setting (it is one of only two Shakespeare plays to observe the Classical unities) and the brevity of the play (Shakespeare's shortest at 1777 lines), along with the great abundance of legal terminology, suggests to some critics the probability of it being written especially for the Gray's Inn performance, which would place its composition in the latter half of 1594. If it was written for Gray's Inn, it most likely represents the first play by Shakespeare which was specifically commissioned. In this case, that commission could have come from Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, a member of the Inns of Court, and Shakespeare's patron." },

Also in 1598, Robert Tofte mentioned the play in his sonnet sequence Alba. The months minde of a melancholy lover; \"Love's Labour Lost, I once did see, a play/Y'cleped so, so called to my pain.\" The date of publication of Alba is unknown as it also was not entered into the Register. Additionally, the play is mentioned in Meres' Palladis Tamia (registered on 7 September, with a dedication dated 10 October). It is unknown exactly which one of these three constitutes the first official record of the play.", "published": "version of the play published in quarto in 1598 as A Pleasant Conceited Comedie called Loves labors lost (the first known printing of a Shakespearean play to include his name on the title page). The Folio text appears under the title Love's Labour's lost.", "performance": "according to the quarto title page, the play was performed at court for Queen Elizabeth sometime over Christmas 1597, however, no further information is provided. The earliest definite performance took place some time between 8 and 15 January 1605, for Anne of Denmark, at either Henry Wriothesley or Robert Cecil's house.", "evidence": "Obviously, the play was written by Christmas 1597, but narrowing the date further has proved difficult, with most efforts focusing upon stylistic evidence. Traditionally, it was seen as one of Shakespeare's earliest plays (Charles Gildon wrote in 1710; \"since it is one of the worst of Shakespeare's Plays, nay I think I may say the very worst, I cannot but think it is his first.') For much of the eighteenth century, it tended to be dated 1590, until Malone's newly constructed chronology in 1778, which dated it 1594. In his 1930 chronology, E.K. Chambers found the play to be more sophisticated than Malone had allowed for, and dated it 1595. Today most scholars tend to concur with a date of 1594-1595, and the play is often grouped with the \"lyrical plays'; Richard II, Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream, because of its prolific use of rhyming. These four plays are argued to represent a phase of Shakespeare's career where he was experimenting with rhyming iambic pentameter as an alternative form to standard blank verse; Richard II has more rhymed verse than any other history play (19.1%), Romeo and Juliet more than any other tragedy (16.6%) and Love's Labour's and Midsummer Night more than any other comedy (43.1% and 45.5% respectively). All four tend to be dated to 1594/1595. In support of this, Ants Oras' pause test places the play after Richard III, which is usually dated 1592. Furthermore, Taylor finds possible allusions to the Gray's Inn revels of December 1594 (specifically the Muscovite masque in Act 5, Scene 2), and also finds plausible Geoffrey Bullough's argument that the satire of the King of Navarre (loosely based on Henry of Navarre, who was associated with oath breaking after abjuring Protestantism in 1593) favours a date after December 1594, when Henry survived an assassination attempt." },
  { "play": "Love's Labour's Won",             "date": "1595-1596", "record": "Francis Meres' Palladis Tamia (1598); referred to as \"Love labours wonne\"", "published": "published in quarto some time prior to 1603", "performance": "there are no recorded performances of the play", "evidence": "There are only two known references to this play. One is in Meres' Palladis Tamia, the other is on a list by Christopher Hunt, dated August 1603, which gives a list of published plays sold by an Exeter bookseller. Up until 1953, only Meres' reference was known, until Hunt's two pages of handwriting were discovered in the backing of a copy of Thomas Gataker's Certaine Sermones. The discovery was handed over to T.W. Baldwin, who published his findings in 1957 as Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Won. The title suggests the play was written as a sequel to Love's Labour's Lost, which is partially supported by the unusually open-ended nature of that play, hence Love's Labour's Won's position in the Oxford chronology. However, whether the play ever existed has been debated, with some critics speculating that it is simply another name for one of Shakespeare's known plays, a situation similar to Henry VIII, which was originally performed with the title All is True. As Meres refers to The Two Gentlemen of Verona, The Comedy of Errors and The Merchant of Venice, prior to the discovery of the Hunt reference, a common suggestion was The Taming of the Shrew, but as Hunt mentions this play, it could not be Love's Labour's Won. Although Much Ado About Nothing, All's Well That Ends Well and Troilus and Cressida have also been cited as possibilities, these plays tend to be dated later than 1598 (much later in the case of Troilus, although the argument is that Love's Labour's Won is an early draft), and as there are no other pre-1598 Shakespearean comedies with which to equate it, it seems certain that the play did exist, that it was performed and published, but that it has since been lost." },
  { "play": "Richard II",                      "date": "1595",      "record": "entered into the Stationers' Register on 29 August 1597 as \"the Tragedye of Richard the Second'.", "published": "version of the play published in quarto in 1597 as The Tragedie of King Richard the second (republished in 1598 (twice), 1608 and 1615). The Folio text appears under the title The life and death of King Richard the Second", "performance": "possible performance on 9 December 1595 at Sir Edward Hoby's house. Hoby's wife, the daughter of Baron Hunsdon (chief patron of the Lord Chamberlain's Men), wrote a letter to Sir Robert Cecil inviting him to supper and to see \"K. Richard present him self to your vewe.\" Many scholars see this as a reference to Richard II, especially because of the Hunsdon connection with Shakespeare's company. However, some scholars argue that the reference could be to a painting, not a play, whilst others argue there is no evidence that \"K. Richard\" necessarily refers to Richard II, suggesting it could refer to Richard III or to another play entirely. There is no complete consensus on this issue, although most scholars do tend to favour the Richard II theory. The earliest definite performance was at the Globe Theatre on 7 February 1601, organised by the Earl of Essex in a performance probably intended to inspire his supporters on the eve of his armed rebellion against Queen Elizabeth. According to testimony given by actor Augustine Phillips at Essex' trial for treason, he paid the Lord Chamberlain's Men forty shillings more than the standard rate to stage the play.", "evidence": "Richard II is usually seen as one of the \"lyrical plays', along with Love's Labour's Lost, Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream; four plays in which Shakespeare used rhymed iambic pentameter more than anywhere else in his career. The four plays also include elaborate punning, rhetorical patterning, a general avoidance of colloquialisms and a high volume of metrical regularity. All four of these plays tend to be dated to 1594-1595. Also important in dating the play is Samuel Daniel's The First Four Books of the Civil Wars, which was entered into the Stationers' Register on 11 October 1594, and published in early 1595. Although some scholars have suggested that Daniel used Shakespeare as a source, which would mean the play was written somewhat earlier than 1594, most agree that Shakespeare used Daniel, especially in some of the later scenes, meaning the play could not have been written earlier than 1595." },

Shakespeare's source for the casket subplot is believed to have been Richard Robinson's translation of the Gesta romanorum, which wasn't published until late 1595. In addition, Salarino's reference to \"my wealthy Andrew docked in sand\" is thought to refer to the San Andréas, a Spanish merchant vessel that ran aground in Essex in June 1596.

In addition, because the play is not mentioned in Meres' Palladis Tamia, registered in September 1598, it was unlikely to have been performed prior to then. This places the date of composition as somewhere between September 1598 and September 1599. Additionally, textual analysis has connected the play to Henry V, which was almost certainly written in 1599, suggesting so too was Julius Caesar." },

The title page of the first quarto states that it had been performed in London, at the two universities of Cambridge and Oxford, \"and else-where', presumably on tour in the provinces. The first definite dated performance took place on a ship anchored off the coast of Africa in September 1607, the Red Dragon. The play was performed by the crew.", "evidence": "Because the versions of Hamlet which appeared in 1603, in 1604 (again in quarto) and in the First Folio of 1623 differ so much from one another, dating the play is exceptionally difficult. There is also the problem of the Ur-Hamlet, a possible source used by Shakespeare, now lost. Others however, feel that Ur-Hamlet (if it ever existed) was most likely an early draft. Hamlet was written sometime between September 1598 (as it was not included in Meres' Palladis Tamia) and July 1602 (when it was registered in the Stationers Register). Furthermore, internal references to Julius Caesar would indicate the play could not have been written any earlier than September 1599. Additionally, in his 1598 copy of an edition of Geoffrey Chaucer's works, Gabriel Harvey has written that Shakespeare's \"Lucrece & his tragedie of Hamlet, prince of Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort'. Harvey also mentions the Earl of Essex as still alive, which would suggest he wrote the note prior to 25 February 1601, when Essex was executed. This would seem to narrow the date of composition to between September 1599 and February 1601; however, not all scholars accept the veracity of Harvey's note. Internal evidence in the play has also been cited, usually as illustrative of a date of composition of 1600 or 1601. As such, many scholars interpret the available evidence as suggestive of a date of initial composition sometime in 1600, with subsequent revisions. This dating, however, is far from universally accepted." },

Obviously the play was written (in some form) prior to December 1604. The only other evidence are possible topical references within the play itself which would seem to indicate a date most likely in 1602, but this is not universally accepted by all scholars. Furthermore, there is a theory that Thomas Middleton rewrote the play after Shakespeare's death, possibly in 1621, which throws further doubt on the exact date of initial composition." },

Additionally, scholars generally agree that the play is indebted to Samuel Harsnett's Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures (entered into the Stationers' Register on 16 March 1603) and John Florio's 1603 translation of Montaigne's Essays., placing the date of composition as somewhere between March 1603 and December 1606. A further possible source for the play has evoked some disagreement however. Whilst many scholars feel that Shakespeare used the anonymous play The True Chronicle History of King Leir (entered into the Stationers' Register on 8 May 1605), and hence must have been written between May 1605 and December 1606, others argue that the relationship between the two plays has been inverted, and The True Chronicle History of King Leir was actually written to capitalise on the success of Shakespeare's play, which was probably written in 1603 or 1604. No real critical consensus has been reached regarding this disagreement." },

There is no reference to the play whatsoever prior to 1623, and as such, evidence for its date of composition must come from within the play itself. Taylor concludes that Middleton and Shakespeare were jointly responsible for the play and assigns the composition date to 1605 on the basis of previous analyses of colloquialism-in-verse and rare vocabulary." },
  { "play": "Macbeth",                         "date": "1606",      "record": "possibly by Simon Forman, who records seeing the play in April 1611. However, there is considerable debate amongst scholars as to whether Forman's account is genuine", "published": "First Folio (1623) as The Tragedie of Macbeth", "performance": "possibly in April 1611, recorded by Simon Forman", "evidence": "Scholars place the date of composition as somewhere between 1603 and 1607, but efforts to narrow that date have proved inconclusive. Several possible topical references to the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 have been proposed and debated among scholars, but these references have not been universally accepted. In 1790, Edward Malone dated the play to 1606, and the vast majority of critics agree with this date even while acknowledging that little conclusive evidence exists, though the date seems correct in the context of Shakespeare's other work of the period. One suggested allusion supporting a date in late 1606 is the first witch's dialogue about a sailor's wife: \"'Aroint thee, witch!\" the rump-fed ronyon cries./Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger\" (1.6-7). This has been thought to allude to the Tiger, a ship that returned to England 27 June 1606 after a disastrous voyage in which many of the crew were killed by pirates. A few lines later the witch speaks of the sailor, \"He shall live a man forbid:/Weary se'nnights nine times nine\" (1.21-2). The real ship was at sea 567 days, the product of 7x9x9, which has been taken as a confirmation of the allusion, which if correct, confirms that the play could not have been written any earlier than July 1606. A. R. Braunmuller, however, in the New Cambridge edition, finds the 1605-6 arguments inconclusive, and argues only for an earliest date of 1603. Further complicating the dating of Macbeth is the fact that the play shows evidence of later revisions by Middleton, particularly in the witch scenes." },

It first appears together with Shakespeare's other plays in the second issue of the Third Folio of 1664. In a contested field, the most widely accepted theory today is that Shakespeare collaborated on the play with another playwright, probably his younger colleague, George Wilkins. There is no complete agreement what the motives or mechanism of this collaboration were. In 1608, Wilkins published a prose narrative of Pericles purporting to be a narrative version of the play and which contains numerous phrases that seem to recall specific lines in the play, suggesting that work on the play preceded his composition of the prose version. Textual analysis of the play has suggested it be placed as in some close relation with All's Well That Ends Well and Coriolanus, which would confirm a date of 1607-1608." },

Shakespeare's treatment of the grain riots is strikingly reminiscent of the Midlands corn riots of 1607. Though Menenius' fable of the belly was used in other contemporary works, the wording of Menenius's speech about the body politic is derived from William Camden's Remaines (1605). Two possible echoes of George Chapman's Iliad (registered 14 November 1608) support a date of 1608-9. A reference to \"the coal of fire upon ice\" (1.1.170) is a possible allusion to the winter of 1607-08, when the frost was so severe that vendors set up booths on the frozen Thames river and pans of coals were placed on the ice so that pedestrians could warm themselves. An allusion to the complaints about Hugh Myddelton's project to bring water to London has also been detected in Martius' warning to the patricians (3.1.98-9). Taylor says that the cumulative internal evidence all points to a composition date of no earlier than spring of 1608, while others favour late 1608 to early 1609. Several allusions in other works establish a terminal date of composition: Ben Jonson's Epicœne, or The silent woman, composed in late 1609, mocks a peculiar phrase in the play, and Phantasma (registered 6 February 1609), written by Robert Armin, a member of the King's Men from 1599 to 1610, contains a close literary parallel. Critics also suggest that the regular act intervals indicate that it could have been written for the indoor Blackfriars Theatre, which Shakespeare's company acquired in 1608." },
